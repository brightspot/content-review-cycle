# Review Cycle

## Code pre-configurations
In the /core/build.gradle file, the library will first need to be added.

Content types utilizing the review cycle functionality will need to implement the HasReviewCycle interface. Subsequently, you will be able to see the content type in the content type map dropdown and in the review cycle overrides cluster within the overrides tab.
